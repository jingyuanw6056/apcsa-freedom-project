I spent quite some time looking into how sprites work within the Unity Engine, specifically the 2D aspect of the engine.
As I am still planning, I followed some videos (An example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on9nwbZngyw&ab_channel=Brackeys)) to grasp some basic understanding of the concept

Through using "How to learn" and "how to google". I got some tutorials with googling that can help me code my rogue-like/adventure platformer game. And from what I can tell, I need to set up something called seed so I can create [random levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puLpZIAGAcM&ab_channel=diving_squid).

As for school days goes by fast, and winter break approaching. I wanted to draw some simple sprites and tinker with them inside of the engine, like simple movements and testing for hitboxes 

Using "How to Google" and "Growth mindset". I googled up tutorials that helped me with certain parts of my learning and i kept my growth mindset and experimented with certain aspects of my software.
